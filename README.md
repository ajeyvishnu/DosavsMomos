This project showcases a state-wise comparison of demand for Dosa and Momos across India using data from **Zomato Trends** ([Zomato Trends](https://www.zomato.com/trends/)), collected from July 2023 to June 2024. The dashboard, created in Tableau, visualizes how food preferences vary regionally, highlighting which states lean toward Dosa or Momos.

The project is inspired by Ashrisâ€™s *India in Pixels* ([Instagram Link](https://www.instagram.com/india.in.pixels/?hl=en)), which creatively visualizes data-driven stories about India.
